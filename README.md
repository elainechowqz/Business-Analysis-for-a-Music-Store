# SQL Data Analysis and Business Intelligence for a Music Store
Several SQL projects for various business questions related to a digital music store, with visualizations

SQL data analysis ---> actionable business insights (related to customers, markets, employee performance, and various products, etc.)

## Overview
These are my SQL projects based on the Chinook database, a database for a music store (database schema below). They are modified or generalized from the final projects for the "Intermediate SQL for Data Analysis" course provided by DataQuest. The projects showcase my SQL skills and business intelligence capabilities. Below, you will find a brief overview of each project.

## Projects

### 1. Genre Sales Analysis
In this project, I analyze the sales results of different music genres within the digital music store and provide recommendations for future purchases. For more details on this project, see the SQL file "Sales by Genre". 

**Insights:**  
- Analysis of genre popularity and sales performance.
- Recommendations for genres and artists the store should invest in.

### 2. Customer Segmentation and Employee Performance
This project is divided into two parts, as outlined below. For more details on this two-part project, see the SQL file "Sales and Employee Performance by Country". 

**2.1 Customer Segmentation by Country:**  
I segment the customers based on their countries and analyze the corresponding sales data.

**Insights:**  
- Identification of high-value markets.
- Strategic recommendations for market-specific promotions.

**2.2 Employee Performance Analysis:**  
The performances of sales representatives are first evaluated in general. Then we investigate if their performances were affected by external factors like the countries of their customers. 

**Insights:**  
- Evaluation of sales representatives' efficiency and success rate.
- Recommendations for performance improvements and employee training.

### 3. Album vs Track Purchases Analysis
The most complex of the three, this project involves determining the percentage of invoices that contain purchases of entire albums versus individual tracks. This analysis is crucial for making informed business decisions regarding inventory management. For more details on this project, see the SQL file "Business Decision - Albums vs Individual Tracks". 

**Insights:**  
- Insights on customer buying patterns.
- Recommendations on whether to focus on selling more albums or individual tracks.
